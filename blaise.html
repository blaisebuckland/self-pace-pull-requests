      <h2>What is branching?</h2>
      <p>
        A branch is a copy of the main version of the code, used work on something separately from the main branch, so it won't interfere with the main branch and break everything for everyone.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>What is merging?</h2>
      <p>
        Once you've finished the work on your branch you'll want to incorporate you changes into the main branch, this is merging.
      </p>

      <h2>What is a pull request?</h2>
      <p>
        Once you've finished what you're working on, you can't just merge it into the main yourself, that would be insane, you need someone to check it first. So you create a pull request, this means the owners of the codebase can review your work, leave you comments and you can make any changes as required. Once you've made any required changes you can push your changes again, which will update the pull request. Then it can be merged into the main branch.
